# LedgerSMB Official Project Gentoo Overlay

Welcome to the LedgerSMB Gentoo Overlay.  This includes ledgerSMB 1.9, 1.10, and 1.11 and all dependencies
along with some related modules that may also be of use.

Please check back soon regarding design, installation instructions, USE flags
and the like.

## Using the repository

You can install with Layman.  Note this is not yet an official Gentoo overlay
though this is likely to be pursued when we have the main packages complete.
